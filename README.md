## My process
I first started with the background, made the main which holds all the 3 different div's inside for each section, gave all of those a div id, the made them all have the colours, styling inside css, added in the information and pictures, added the styling again, then I did the @media's. Started with a website first approach.

### Built with

- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
